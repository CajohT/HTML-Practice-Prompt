         <h1>Book Store Website</h1>
            <p> My goal is to create a book store website with my mother. I love to read and I have used online bookstores to purchase the books that I couldn't find in person. Like when I couldn't find The Maze Runner Death cure or Four from The Divergent series I ordered them. Online bookstores are also great for students when they get books assigned and they need them fast. I needed a book called Kindred for my English class and received it within a few days.
         <br>
         My mom has hundreds of books around the house and we had the idea of selling them online. We want to give people a less expensive alternative for buying books. We would like them to receive their books quickly and easily. Our goal is for people to read and discover new books on our website that they would enjoy. We want to be the best online book website.
            <br>
            What served as an inspiration was this website called thrift books. This is where I order books from when I can't find them in stores.
            <br>
            What continues to inspire me is this program because now I have the opportunity to actually make the website.
